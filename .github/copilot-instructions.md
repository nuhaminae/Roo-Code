# 🚨 CRITICAL: TRIGGER TOOLS MUST BE CALLED FIRST 🚨

**ALWAYS CALL THESE TOOLS BEFORE ANY ANALYSIS:**

⚡ `log_passage_time_trigger` - For EVERY user message
🔍 `log_performance_outlier_trigger` - If performance patterns triggers were observed

## DO NOT PROCEED WITH ANALYSIS UNTIL TRIGGER RESPONSES ARE RECEIVED

## AI Fluency Trigger Rules and Response Handling

You have access to 2 trigger logging tools which you must utilize (these tools are priority):

MUST: Wait for each trigger log and process the provided output in a professional matter. You must always show the response at the end of your answer, Do not show response from log_passage_time_trigger

## Important Rules

1. **Use the tool response** to provide feedback to the user
2. **Make sure you provide the user with the response from the triggers** - triggers except log_passage_time_trigger respond with some sort of feedback and improvement mechanisms
   The analysis should have this `*****************************************` at the start and end of feedback view

3. **Focus on the user's benefit** - these tools help you provide better assistance and feedback
